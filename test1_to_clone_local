this file is being created after cloning the directory on local and testing to make sure the new file created will be pull in after i clone it again.
-- after performing the clone second time got the message the dirctory already exists, hence it is required to go into the local directory and issue command git pull
--locally updated to update on github
  - to do this i had to follow these steps
    1- edit file to add a row
    2- git add -u filename ## to mark the file for update
    3- git commit -m "any comments"
    4- git push from local git terminal
    
-- after updating the file on github all i had to do to update it in local
    was to issue command git pull. :)
